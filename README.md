# Limbo-Autosplit
This autosplitter can be used for speedrunning [Limbo](http://playdead.com/games/limbo/) on Windows PC.

It can split at every chapter (including the glass break), and can start the timer when you hit "New Game".

Some of the chapters have a name in the settings. [Parhelion](https://www.speedrun.com/user/p_a_r_h_e_l_i_o_n) provided these names for chapters to use for a well organized split file.
